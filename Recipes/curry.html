    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless chicken breasts (or thighs), cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 can of chickpeas (approx. 400g), rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>200 ml heavy cream (or cooking cream)</li>
        <li>1–2 tsp curry powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp sweet paprika</li>
        <li>A pinch of chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Cooking oil (vegetable or sunflower oil)</li>
        <li>Basmati or jasmine rice (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the rice according to the instructions on the package. Optionally, rinse it beforehand to prevent clumping.</li>
        <li>Heat a bit of oil in a large pan or pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the pan, season with a bit of salt, and cook until they start to brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle in the curry powder, paprika, and chili powder. Stir well and let the spices cook for about 30 seconds to release their flavor.</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed chickpeas and Worcestershire sauce. Stir everything together.</li>
        <li>Pour in the cream and mix well. Let the curry simmer for about 10–15 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly and the chicken is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt or chili if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve hot over a bed of rice. Optionally, garnish with fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley.</li>
    </ol>
